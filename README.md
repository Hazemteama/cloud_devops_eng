This was a bear of a project and required substantial troubleshooting and reading through the docs along with much time spent in the Student Hub forums as well as on our old friend StackOverflow. This project was much harder than it needed to be. Had there been a little more detailed guidance from the content the learning experience could have been just as thorough but with less head-banging.
